Hello! I am a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science at [National Tsing Hua University](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/). I recently completed a summer internship at Google, where I gained hands-on experience in cutting-edge technology. My research focuses on cloud computing and distributed systems, and I’m thrilled to share that my paper, KubeComp, was accepted at [UCC](https://ucc.uccbdcat2024.org/index.html)!

During my undergraduate years, I participated twice in international student cluster competitions. Our team won the championship at [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/) in Dallas, USA, and placed second at [ISC23](https://www.hpcadvisorycouncil.com/events/2023/student-cluster-competition/) in Hamburg, Germany. Preparing for these competitions sparked my interest in high-performance computing (HPC).

In 2023, I spent a semester as an exchange student at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en) in Germany, where I enjoyed the enriching experience of immersing myself in a different culture.
